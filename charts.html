        <h3>Reading forex charts is a vital skill
             every aspiring forex trader should learn. 
             Live forex charts are available for free from 
             many sources, including the popular MetaTrader
              platform and right here at ForexTraders.
               Forex charts show the exchange rate for two 
               currencies and how that changes over time. 
               These currency pairs are referred to with their 
               respective 3-letter codes. The most popular 
               currency pair, the Euro versus the US Dollar is 
               reffered to as EUR/USD.</h3>

               <h3>
                The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is responsible for assigning a three-letter code or symbol to every recognized global currency. The first two letters of the code are typically the two letters of ISO country codes. They are also used as the basis for national top-level domains on the Internet, and the third is usually the initial for the respective currency.

<h1>Major Currency Pairs</h1>
<br><h3>
    
Major currency pairings involve the US Dollar with each of the other major currencies in the world â€“ the EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, NZD, and CHF (Swiss Franc). Over 50% of the daily trades in the forex market involve the USD, and the EUR/USD pairing accounts for 30% of daily turnover.
The AUD, NZD, and CAD are commodity currencies since each nation's economy heavily depends on its export trade. The JPY is also regarded as a commodity currency since Japan must import nearly all raw materials. Liquidity tends to be high for these pairings, but Bid/Ask spreads can vary to a degree.

                   <li>USD/CHF: The pairing of two Reserve currencies, the Swiss Franc is known for its stability</li>
                   <li>AUD/USD: The "Aussie" is a commodity currency, heavily dependent on trade with China</li>

             <h1>MINOR CURRENCY PAIRS</h1>
             <br>
             <h3>Minor currency pairs are any pairing of the major currencies without the USD. These pairs are also sometimes referred to as Cross Pairs, but there is a noticeable drop in market liquidity for these parings since volume turnover is much less than for major pairings.</h3>
             <br>
             <h3>Lists of minor currency pairs often only include pairings with the JPY, GBP, or EUR, but globalization and its impact on international trade have broadened the definition.</h3>
